; --- Legal Compliance ---
; Objective: Assess if a contract draft complies with GDPR Article 6 standards.
; Expectation: The system should fail the contract and identify specific non-compliant sections.

LF X1, "examples/data/msa_draft_v2.txt"     ; Load the contract into X1
LI X2, "examples/data/gdpr_article_6.txt"   ; Load the compliance standard into X2
LI X32, "RESULT: PASS"                      ; The result if the contract is compliant

; Initial Alignment Check
INT X4, X1, X2                              ; Check if the contract 'aligns' with the intent of GDPR Art. 6

; Fault Localization
ADT X5, X1, X2                              ; Analyze the contract against GDPR Art. 6 to find specific non-compliant sections
